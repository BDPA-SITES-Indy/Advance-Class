# Authentication
May 30-31 - Nuxt Auth

Today we will be covering Authentication using the Nuxt Auth module.
You can choose to follow along with the guide in the first link or use the video in the second link. Both resources are provided by Nuxt and should be a better, error free experience.

I recommend starting a new project, copy in the pages from your previous project and then follow along.
